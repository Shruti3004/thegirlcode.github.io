## Setup

1. Clone to your machine.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Open `localhost:3039`.
5. To publish a build to the gh-pages branch, use `npm run publish`. This creates a fresh build in the dist folder and then pushes it to the gh-pages branch.
